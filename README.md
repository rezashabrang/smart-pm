## 📖 **Usage Guide**

### 1. **Data Preparation & Processing** 🧹

This section focuses on cleaning and transforming raw project data. It includes techniques for:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Fill in or remove missing values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in project data.
- **Data Scaling**: Standardizing numerical features.
- **Feature Transformation**: Converting project data into a usable format for machine learning models.

**Notebook**: `data_cleaning_and_processing.ipynb`  
**Functions**: `data_preprocessing_functions.py`

---

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊

EDA helps in understanding the project data through various visualizations:

- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution and summary of individual features.
- **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Relationships between features.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalies in project data.
- **Correlation**: Analyzing how features relate to one another.

**Notebook**: `eda_overview.ipynb`  
**Functions**: `eda_visualization_functions.py`

### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🔧

Feature engineering is essential for improving machine learning model performance. It includes:

- **Feature Creation**: Deriving new features from the existing data.
- **Feature Transformation**: Scaling and encoding features.
- **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical data into numerical form for modeling.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputing missing values where necessary.

**Notebook**: `feature_engineering_overview.ipynb`  
**Functions**: `feature_engineering_functions.py`
