### EDA and Feature Engineering on DSLIB Files

#### Objective:

Explore and engineer features from DSLIB datasets for effective machine learning modeling. They will conduct EDA to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and engineer new features based on domain knowledge.

---

### Instructions

#### **Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

1. **Univariate Analysis:**

   - Summarize key statistics (mean, median, variance) of numerical columns.
   - Analyze distributions of numerical features using histograms.
   - Use box plots to identify outliers.

2. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:**

   - Explore relationships between numerical variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
   - Investigate relationships between categorical and numerical variables using bar charts or box plots.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create at least three visualizations to showcase insights, such as:
     - Distribution of project costs.
     - Correlation heatmap for numerical features.
     - Scatter plot of budgeted vs. actual costs.

#### **Part 2: Feature Engineering**

1. **Feature Creation:**

   - **Domain-Specific Features:** Create features such as:
     - Project Duration: Calculate the number of days between project start and end dates.
     - Cost Overrun Ratio: \( \text{Cost Overrun} = \frac{\text{Actual Cost}}{\text{Budgeted Cost}} \)
   - **Interaction Features:** Multiply or combine existing variables to create new informative features.
     - Example: \( \text{Team Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Budgeted Cost}}{\text{Team Size}} \).

2. **Feature Transformation:**

   - Apply log transformation to skewed numerical features (e.g., costs or durations).
   - Scale numerical features using Min-Max Scaling or Standardization (Z-Score).

3. **Feature Selection:**

   - Remove highly correlated features using a threshold (e.g., correlation > 0.85).
   - Use feature importance methods (e.g., tree-based models) to identify and retain the most critical features.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
   - Apply One-Hot Encoding to nominal categorical variables.
   - Use Label Encoding for ordinal features.

### Additional Notes:

1. **Dataset Selection:** Choose a file from the DSLIB library that supports EDA and feature engineering. Justify the choice.
2. **Insights Report:** Document all insights from EDA and the rationale behind feature engineering decisions.

---

### Deliverables

1. **Code and Results:**

   - Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (as a CSV file).
   - EDA visualizations (saved as PNG or embedded in the report).
   - Feature-engineered dataset.

2. **Report:**
   - Summarize findings from EDA.
   - Detail feature engineering steps, including transformations and feature importance.
   - Highlight challenges and insights.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **EDA Quality:** Depth of analysis and clarity of visualizations.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creativity and relevance of new features.
3. **Code Execution:** Accuracy and efficiency of code implementation.
4. **Report Writing:** Clear communication and documentation of processes and insights.
