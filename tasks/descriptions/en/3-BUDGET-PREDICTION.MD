**Building and Tuning Machine Learning Models for Budget Prediction**

---

### **Objective**

The goal of this task is to develop machine learning models to predict project budgets using the DSLIB datasets. You will apply hyperparameter tuning (except manual tuning) to optimize model performance.

### **Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Data Selection and Preparation**

1. **Select Files:**

   - Choose one or more files from the DSLIB library that contain relevant project management data.
   - Justify the choice of files and sheets based on the features available (e.g., project size, team size, cost, duration).

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Extract meaningful.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and scale numerical features using Standardization or Min-Max Scaling.
   - Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

#### **Step 2: Model Development**

1. **Select Models:**

   - Build at least two machine learning models from the following list:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
     - Neural Networks

2. **Train Models:**
   - Train the models on the prepared dataset and evaluate performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R² Score.

#### **Step 3: Hyperparameter Tuning**

1. **Choose a Tuning Method:**

   - Use one or more of the following methods for hyperparameter tuning:
     - **Grid Search**
     - **Random Search**
     - **Bayesian Optimization**
     - **Hyperband**

2. **Optimize Hyperparameters:**
   - Select hyperparameters to tune (e.g., learning rate, max depth, number of estimators).
   - Perform tuning and report the best hyperparameter combinations.

---

#### **Step 4: Reporting**

1. **Model Comparison:**

   - Compare the performance of the models before and after tuning.
   - Highlight how tuning improved the results.

2. **Visualizations:**

   - Include at least three visualizations, such as:
     - A 3D surface plot of Grid Search or Random Search results.
     - Feature importance plots (e.g., bar chart for Random Forest or XGBoost).
     - Performance comparison of models before and after tuning (e.g., line plot of MSE).

3. **Insights:**
   - Summarize key observations and lessons learned during the task.

### **Deliverables**

1. **Code and Results:**

   - Python scripts or notebooks for data preparation, model building, and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Final trained models with their hyperparameter configurations.

2. **Report:**

   - A concise report (700–1000 words) covering:
     - Data selection and preparation.
     - Model development process.
     - Hyperparameter tuning steps and results.
     - Model performance comparison and conclusions.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Include PNGs or embedded graphs in the report.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Data Selection and Preparation:**
   - Quality of feature extraction and preprocessing.
2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Correctness and diversity of implemented models.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Appropriateness of chosen methods and improvement in results.
4. **Reporting and Visualizations:**
   - Clarity, depth, and quality of the report and visualizations.
